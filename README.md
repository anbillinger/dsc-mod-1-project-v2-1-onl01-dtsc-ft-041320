# Module 1 Final Project
By Alex Billinger
With Erica Gabriel

## Purpose
Analyzing data from the movie industry, in order to make actionable recommendations to a new studio, Microsoft, that wants to begin making movies. Also using this analysis to create a presentation, in order to communicate our findings to non-technical people.

## Notebook information
* Student notebook used for cleaning and examing datasets, and explains initial approach to data sets. Also contains link to blog post.
* Erica's code notebook contains work that partner completed
* Genre Info notebook compiles and plots data related to genres and revenues, and explains approach to the related question
* Writers notebook compiles and plots data related to number of writers, and explains approach to the related question

## Questions Asked and Answered
* What are the most lucrative genres?
* Does having more writers have a significant impact on budget or revenue?
* What is the relationship between budget and revenue? -Erica
* Does runtime have an impact on audience enjoyment? -Erica
* What regions are most popular for movie releases? - Erica

## Datasets used
* TN movie budgets
* IMDB title basics
* IMDB title ratings
* IMDB title akas
* IMDB title crew

### Other files in repository:
* TN_budget_and_IMDB.csv which contains combined data from IMDB general information and TN's information on budget and gross revenue
* Presentation.pdf, which is a slideshow of graphs and insights to show our findings
* Visuals folder, which contains individual images of graphs used in slideshow



Still need to add:
A **Video Walkthrough** of your non-technical presentation. Some common video recording tools used are Zoom, Quicktime, and Nimbus. After you record your presentation, publish it on a service like YouTube or Google Drive, you will need a link to the video to submit your project.



In the first half of the presentation (2-3 mins), you should summarize your methodology in a way that will be comprehensible to someone with no background in data science and that will increase their confidence in you and your findings. In the second half (the remaining 2-3 mins) you should summarize your findings and be ready to answer a couple of non-technical questions from the audience. The questions might relate to technical topics (sampling bias, confidence, etc) but will be asked in a non-technical way and need to be answered in a way that does not assume a background in statistics or machine learning. You can assume a smart, business stakeholder, with a non-quantitative college degree.
